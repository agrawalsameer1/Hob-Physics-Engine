It currently supports elastic collisions and gravitational interactions between particles, and is capable of simulating around 1.5k particles in real-time at around 25 FPS. For simulations larger than this, it automatically generates a 30 FPS video of the simulation using the [stb_image library](https://github.com/nothings/stb). In addition, because larger simulations can become unstable, the physics engine runs 5 substeps per frame of video for maximum accuracy and stability.

I have implemented the space-partitioning optimization for collision detection, and the Barnes-Hut algorithm with Quadtrees to optimize the gravity simulation.
