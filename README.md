# SDL-Physics-Engine

This is a simple physics engine built in C++ with the SDL Graphics Library. It currently supports elastic collisions and gravitational interactions between particles, and is capable of simulating around 2.5k particles in real-time at around 15 FPS. For simulations larger than this, it automatically generates a 30 FPS video of the simulation using the [stb_image library][https://github.com/nothings/stb]
