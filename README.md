Please also see [my extension to this project](https://github.com/sameeragrawal536/HartreeFockEngine), in which I implemented the Hartree-Fock algorithm from scratch for Quantum N-Body simulations!

The Hob Physics Engine is a 2D physics engine built in C++ with the SDL Graphics Library.

It currently supports elastic collisions and gravitational interactions between particles, and is capable of simulating around 1.3k particles in real-time at 30 FPS. For simulations larger than this, it automatically generates a 30 FPS video of the simulation using the [stb_image library](https://github.com/nothings/stb). 

I have implemented the space-partitioning optimization for collision detection, and the Quadtree Barnes-Hut algorithm to optimize n-body gravity simulation. I have also implemented the 4th Order Runge-Kutta method for maximum simulation stability.
